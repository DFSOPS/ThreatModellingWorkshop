Summary MITRE ATT&CK Sequence
=============================

Attack Description
------------------

In this Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack scenario, the attacker overwhelms the SolarisHealthApp and its BackendServer with a massive volume of traffic, aiming to disrupt service availability. The attack begins with reconnaissance to identify targets and network vulnerabilities, followed by weaponization where the attacker configures a botnet to execute the attack. During the delivery phase, the attacker floods the BackendServer with malicious traffic, exploiting network resources to cause service outages. The attacker maintains control through a command and control (C2) server, adjusting attack methods to evade mitigation efforts. The ultimate goal is to cause significant disruption and potential financial impact. Defensive measures include DDoS protection services, rate limiting, traffic monitoring, scalable infrastructure, and redundancy to mitigate and manage the attack's effects effectively.
