# DDoS Attack Mitigation Controls

| **Control**                          | **Description**                                                                                                     | **Implementation**                                                                                       |

| **DDoS Protection Services**          | Use specialized services to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks.                                                        | Subscribe to cloud-based DDoS protection services (e.g., AWS Shield, Cloudflare).                       |
| **Rate Limiting**                    | Limit the number of requests from a single IP address to prevent overload.                                           | Configure rate limiting rules on web servers and firewalls.                                              |
| **Traffic Monitoring**               | Monitor traffic patterns to detect unusual spikes or anomalies.                                                       | Implement network monitoring tools and set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns.                     |
| **Scalable Infrastructure**          | Use scalable infrastructure to handle traffic surges.                                                                | Deploy auto-scaling groups, use load balancers, and leverage cloud infrastructure for scalability.      |
| **Redundancy**                       | Implement redundancy to ensure availability during an attack.                                                          | Set up multiple data centers, use failover systems, and deploy backup servers.                          |
| **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**   | Protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.                                                    | Configure WAF rules to block malicious traffic and protect against common attack vectors.               |
| **Anycast Network**                  | Use Anycast routing to distribute traffic across multiple locations.                                                 | Employ Anycast IP addresses to spread attack traffic and reduce impact on any single location.          |
| **Network ACLs and Firewalls**       | Set up network access control lists and firewalls to block malicious traffic.                                         | Configure firewalls and ACLs to restrict incoming traffic and block known attack patterns.              |
| **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**   | Use CDNs to absorb and distribute traffic across a global network.                                                    | Implement a CDN to cache content and distribute load, reducing the impact of DDoS attacks.              |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**  | Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to balance the load.                                              | Use ALBs to balance traffic and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.                    |
| **DNS Protection**                   | Protect DNS infrastructure to prevent DNS amplification attacks.                                                      | Use DNS protection services to safeguard against DNS-based DDoS attacks.                                |
| **Incident Response Plan**           | Develop a response plan to quickly address and mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack.                                | Create and regularly update an incident response plan that includes procedures for DDoS attacks.        |
