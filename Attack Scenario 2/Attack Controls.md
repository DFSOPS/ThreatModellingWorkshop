### Main Attack Control Measures Against SQL Injections

| Control | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1\. Input Validation and Sanitization | Implement strict input validation to ensure that all user inputs conform to expected formats, rejecting any input that contains SQL syntax or unexpected characters. Use sanitization techniques to clean user inputs before processing them, neutralizing potentially harmful data. |
| 2\. Parameterized Queries | Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements in database interactions to ensure that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks. |
| 3\. Web Application Firewall (WAF) | Deploy a WAF to monitor and filter incoming traffic to the application, helping to detect and block malicious requests that may contain SQL injection payloads. |
| 4\. Regular Security Audits | Conduct frequent security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the application, ensuring that security measures are effective and up to date. |
| 5\. Monitoring and Logging | Implement comprehensive logging of database queries and user activities. Continuous monitoring can help detect unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts, allowing for timely responses to potential breaches. |
| 6\. User Access Controls | Enforce the principle of least privilege for database accounts, ensuring that users and applications have only the necessary permissions to perform their functions, reducing the impact of a successful attack. |
