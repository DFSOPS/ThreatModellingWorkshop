### Attack Control Measures for SQL Injection Attack on Health App

#### 1\. Reconnaissance

-   Control Measures:
    -   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on requests to prevent automated tools from scanning the application.
    -   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF to block suspicious traffic and detect reconnaissance activities.
    -   Security Headers: Use security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy) to protect the application from certain types of attacks.

#### 2\. Weaponization

-   Control Measures:
    -   Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and eliminate areas where input validation could be bypassed.
    -   Security Training: Provide training for developers on secure coding practices, particularly regarding input handling.

#### 3\. Delivery

-   Control Measures:
    -   Input Validation: Implement strict input validation to reject unexpected input formats before they reach the application logic.
    -   CAPTCHA: Use CAPTCHA on forms to prevent automated submissions.

#### 4\. Exploitation

-   Control Measures:
    -   Sanitization of Input: Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized and escaped appropriately before being processed by the database.
    -   Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.

#### 5\. Installation

-   Control Measures:
    -   Database Permissions: Implement the principle of least privilege for database accounts, ensuring they have only the necessary permissions.
    -   Audit Logs: Maintain thorough logging of database changes and access to track unauthorized modifications.

#### 6\. Command and Control (C2)

-   Control Measures:
    -   Continuous Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect unusual database queries or access patterns.
    -   Regular Backups: Ensure regular backups of databases to facilitate recovery in case of a compromise.

#### 7\. Actions on Objectives

-   Control Measures:
    -   Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.
    -   Incident Response Plan: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly address any data breaches or unauthorized access.

### Summary of Impact Controls

-   Patient Safety Risks: Establish a protocol for immediate review of any anomalies in patient data to prevent potential harm.
-   Privacy Violations: Implement data access controls and regularly review who has access to sensitive information.
-   Reputational Damage: Prepare a communication strategy for transparency with users in the event of a breach.
-   Financial Loss: Allocate a budget for security measures and incident response to mitigate financial risks associated with breaches.

### Conclusion

This attack control framework provides a structured approach to mitigating the risks associated with SQL Injection attacks on health applications. By implementing these measures across each stage of the attack lifecycle, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect sensitive patient information effectively.
