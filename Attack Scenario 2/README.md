### Attack Scenario: SQL Injection Attack on Health App

#### 1\. Reconnaissance

The attacker identifies the health app and its backend database structure through various means, such as:

-   Analyzing the app's web interface for input fields (e.g., login forms, search boxes).
-   Using automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in the app's API endpoints.

#### Weaponization

The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the app's input validation. For example, they create a payload that could be injected into a login form to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.

#### Delivery

The attacker delivers the crafted SQL injection payload by submitting it through the app's input fields. This could be done through:

-   Directly entering the payload into a login form.
-   Sending a crafted request to the app's API endpoints.

#### Exploitation

The health app fails to properly sanitize the input, allowing the SQL injection payload to be executed against the backend database. This could lead to:

-   Unauthorized access to user accounts.
-   Retrieval of sensitive data, such as patient records, prescriptions, and appointment details.

#### Installation

While this step is less applicable in a traditional sense for SQL injection, the attacker may establish a foothold by:

-   Creating a new admin account in the database.
-   Modifying existing user roles to gain elevated privileges.

#### Command and Control (C2)

The attacker can now control the compromised database. They may:

-   Use the access to extract data continuously.
-   Set up scripts or automated queries to maintain access and gather information over time.

#### Actions on Objectives

The attacker can perform various malicious actions, including:

-   Data Theft: Extracting sensitive patient information, including personal details, prescriptions, and appointment histories.
-   Data Manipulation: Altering prescription details or appointment times, potentially endangering patient health.
-   Identity Theft: Using stolen information to impersonate patients, leading to fraudulent activities.

### Impact:

-   Patient Safety Risks: Altered prescriptions or appointments could lead to serious health consequences.
-   Privacy Violations: Sensitive health information is compromised, leading to potential identity theft.
-   Reputational Damage: The health app provider faces backlash for failing to protect user data.
-   Financial Loss: Costs associated with recovery efforts and potential legal liabilities.

### Mitigations:

-   Input Validation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks.
-   Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to ensure that user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.
-   Regular Security Audits: Conduct frequent security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the app.
-   Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring to detect unusual database queries and access patterns.

This scenario provides a comprehensive view of a SQL injection attack on a health app, illustrating the various stages of an attack and the importance of proactive security measures.
