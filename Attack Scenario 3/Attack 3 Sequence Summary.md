Summary MITRE ATT&CK Sequence
=============================
Attack Description
------------------

In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on a health app, the attacker exploits network communication vulnerabilities, such as unencrypted HTTP or weak SSL/TLS configurations, to intercept and manipulate data between the app and its server. The attack begins with reconnaissance, where the attacker uses tools like Wireshark to identify weaknesses in the app's communication. Next, they weaponize their findings by setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point or using ARP spoofing to intercept traffic. The attacker then delivers the attack by positioning themselves between the user and the server, capturing sensitive information such as login credentials and payment details, and potentially altering prescription data. To maintain persistence, they hijack sessions or modify traffic to create a backdoor. Command and control are established through covert channels for continuous data exfiltration, while actions on objectives include stealing data, committing financial fraud, or disrupting services. To mitigate such attacks, it is crucial to encrypt all communications with HTTPS and strong SSL/TLS settings, use certificate pinning, educate users about Wi-Fi risks, implement network monitoring, and ensure secure session management with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
