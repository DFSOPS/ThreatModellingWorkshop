## **Attack 3 Scenario: Man-in-the-Middle Attack**


Here's a **cyberattack scenario** involving a **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack** on a health app, using the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework. The attacker exploits weaknesses in the app's network communication, targeting insecure connections to intercept sensitive information like prescription records, payment details, and appointment schedules.

### **Attack Overview: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**

The attacker intercepts unencrypted or poorly secured traffic between the health app and its server. This allows them to steal sensitive information like user credentials, medical data, and payment details, or even modify app responses and requests.

* * * * *

### 1\. **Reconnaissance** (Information Gathering)

**Objective**: Identify network vulnerabilities in how the health app communicates with the server.

-   The attacker uses tools like **Wireshark** or **ZAP Proxy** to monitor and analyze traffic between the health app and the server.
-   They discover that the app uses **unencrypted HTTP** for some requests or weak **SSL/TLS configurations** (e.g., outdated ciphers or the absence of certificate pinning).
-   By reviewing app communication during logins, prescription lookups, and payments, they observe that sensitive data (e.g., login tokens or prescription records) is exposed in plaintext or weakly encrypted during transit.

* * * * *

### 2\. **Weaponization** (Preparing the Attack)

**Objective**: Craft an attack that intercepts and manipulates the data sent between the user and the server.

-   The attacker configures a **rogue Wi-Fi access point** or uses tools like **Ettercap** to set up an active MitM attack, where they can intercept, decrypt, or manipulate communications between the app and the server.
-   They develop a script that can automatically intercept login credentials or modify prescription data being sent or received, potentially injecting malicious commands or altering payment details.

* * * * *

### 3\. **Delivery** (Executing the Attack)

**Objective**: Deliver the attack by setting up a MitM position between the health app and the server.

-   The attacker lures users into connecting to their rogue Wi-Fi access point (e.g., in a public place like a pharmacy or clinic offering free Wi-Fi). Once connected, all traffic between the health app and the server is routed through the attacker's system.
-   Alternatively, the attacker exploits **ARP spoofing** in the user's local network to position themselves as an intermediary between the user's device and the legitimate health app server.

* * * * *

### 4\. **Exploitation** (Intercepting Data)

**Objective**: Exploit the insecure communication to capture sensitive information.

-   As users log into the health app, the attacker intercepts **login credentials**, **session tokens**, or other sensitive information (e.g., prescription orders or medical records).
-   They capture **credit card numbers** and payment details during transactions between the app and its payment processing system.
-   The attacker can also manipulate the data being sent or received, for example by **altering prescription orders** (changing drug types or quantities) or **rerouting payments** to their own accounts.

* * * * *

### 5\. **Installation** (Establishing Persistence)

**Objective**: Maintain a foothold to continue intercepting communications.

-   The attacker uses **session hijacking** to maintain access to the app without needing to continuously intercept traffic. By stealing and reusing session tokens, they can log in as the user at any time.
-   They modify the traffic in a way that triggers a **persistent backdoor** in the app, which might involve tampering with API responses to download malicious updates or redirect data requests to attacker-controlled servers.

* * * * *

### 6\. **Command and Control (C2)**

**Objective**: Communicate with the compromised app to exfiltrate data and control actions.

-   The attacker sets up a **covert communication channel** between the compromised app and their own server using encrypted traffic. This allows them to continue exfiltrating sensitive health and payment data without raising alarms.
-   They also monitor ongoing communications for further opportunities, such as new prescriptions or payments made by the app users, gaining continuous access to real-time data.

* * * * *

### 7\. **Actions on Objectives** (Data Exfiltration, Financial Fraud, or Service Disruption)

**Objective**: Achieve the attack's ultimate goals, such as stealing data, committing fraud, or disrupting service.

-   **Data Exfiltration**: The attacker steals large amounts of patient data, including medical records, prescription details, and payment information, which they either sell on the dark web or use for further fraud schemes.
-   **Financial Fraud**: The attacker reroutes prescription payments to their own accounts or uses stolen credit card information to make fraudulent purchases.
-   **Service Disruption**: They modify responses from the health app's server to alter prescriptions (e.g., changing dosages, deleting appointments, or ordering the wrong medication), causing confusion and disruption for patients and healthcare providers.

* * * * *

### Defensive Measures and Mitigation Strategies

-   **Encryption**: Ensure all communication between the app and the server is encrypted using **HTTPS** with strong **SSL/TLS** configurations. Implement **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** to prevent downgrade attacks.
-   **Certificate Pinning**: Use **certificate pinning** to prevent attackers from using forged certificates in MitM attacks.
-   **Wi-Fi Security Awareness**: Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted or public Wi-Fi networks.
-   **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring tools to detect anomalous traffic or unusual login patterns that could indicate a MitM attack.
-   **Session Management**: Ensure secure session management, such as expiring session tokens after a period of inactivity and using **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to protect user accounts.

This scenario highlights how network vulnerabilities can be exploited in health apps that handle sensitive medical and payment data, emphasizing the importance of secure communication protocols and vigilant network security practices.
