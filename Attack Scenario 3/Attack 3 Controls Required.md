**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack** in the health app scenario:

| **Control Area** | **Control** | **Description** | **Objective** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Network Security** | **Encryption (SSL/TLS)** | Ensure all communication between the health app and server is encrypted using strong TLS protocols. | Protect data in transit from interception. |
| **Network Security** | **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** | Enforce HTTPS usage by ensuring the browser only accepts secure connections. | Prevent HTTP downgrade attacks. |
| **Network Security** | **Public Wi-Fi Awareness Training** | Educate users to avoid untrusted public Wi-Fi networks and use VPNs when necessary. | Reduce exposure to MitM attacks over public Wi-Fi. |
| **Network Security** | **VPN or Encrypted Tunnel for Mobile Traffic** | Require the use of a VPN or similar secure tunnel for accessing the health app over public networks. | Provide an additional layer of encryption. |
| **Application Security** | **SSL Pinning** | Implement certificate pinning to prevent attackers from using fraudulent certificates during MitM attacks. | Ensure app-server communication uses trusted certificates. |
| **Session Management** | **Secure Session Tokens** | Use strong, securely generated session tokens (e.g., JWTs) and protect them from interception with encryption. | Prevent session hijacking through token capture. |
| **Authentication** | **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Implement MFA to ensure that attackers can't gain unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen. | Add a second layer of security for authentication. |
| **Session Management** | **Session Timeouts** | Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity to minimize session hijacking opportunities. | Limit attacker's access after user inactivity. |
| **Incident Detection** | **Network Anomaly Detection** | Use IDS/IPS or behavioral monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns, like duplicate session tokens. | Detect ongoing MitM attacks or abnormal behavior. |
| **Cryptography** | **Strong Encryption Algorithms** | Use modern, secure encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2/1.3) for both data in transit and at rest. | Protect sensitive data from decryption by attackers. |
| **Access Control** | **Least Privilege Access** | Ensure that users and administrators have the minimum required access privileges to perform their roles. | Limit the impact of a compromised account. |
| **Monitoring and Logging** | **Full Packet Capture or Log Correlation** | Implement network-level logging and monitoring tools that capture detailed traffic logs for analysis. | Investigate and respond to suspicious activities. |
| **User Awareness** | **Phishing and Social Engineering Training** | Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts or malicious apps that mimic the official health app. | Prevent initial attack vectors like rogue apps. |
| **Patch Management** | **Regular Updates and Patches** | Ensure the app, its libraries, and third-party services are regularly updated to fix known vulnerabilities. | Mitigate known weaknesses and exploits. |
| **API Security** | **API Gateway with Secure Authentication** | Use an API gateway that enforces strong authentication and authorization for all API requests. | Prevent unauthorized access to the app's API. |
